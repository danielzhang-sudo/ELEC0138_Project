## Coursework 1
We consider the scenario of a user and a ecommerce website, in which both interact with each other. 
1. Assets
    - User data: The user, by interacting with the website, is providing information such as search queries, purchase history, and other sentsitive personal information sich as name, date of birth, payment information... that the website may use to identify the type of customer he is.
    - Machine Learning (ML) model: The company behind the website uses a ML algorithm to predict the customer needs by using data collected while the users navigate the website.
2. Threats
    - ML model of the website: The ML model that the company uses poses a threat to our privacy as they collect our data while using of the website tom improve their marketing strategies, sell our information or other purposes.
    - Data poisoning: A user concerned with his privacy, may try to purposedly poson the data so that the ML model trains on inaccurate data that does not reflect reality, hindering the predictions of the model. Another threat could be a vendor that sells a product in the ecommerce platform, and is interested in artificially improving the SEO of their product by simulaating high interest in the product.
